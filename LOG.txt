Pair Programming.
Participants: Christian and Jomar.
Progress: -Created the data structure for the snake and coordinates of it's body.  
          -Implemented the snake agent, movement and possible actions.
          -Applied movement and time to the snake.
          -Display the snake on the environment.
          -The snakes follows the Hamiltonian Cycle.
          -Polished the Environment.
          -Base idea for the apple implementation and it's spawning location.
