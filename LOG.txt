April 14, 2021 (2:00 p.m. - 6:00 p.m.):
Pair Programming.
Participants: Christian and Jomar.
Progress: -Display the grid for the game and start developing algorithm to generate a hamiltonian cycle.


April 21, 2021 (2:00 p.m. - 6:00 p.m.):
Pair Programming.
Participants: Christian and Jomar.
Progress: -Created the data structure for the snake and coordinates of it's body.  
          -Implemented the snake agent, movement and possible actions.
          -Applied movement and time to the snake.
          -Display the snake on the environment.
          -The snakes follows the Hamiltonian Cycle.
          -Polished the Environment.
          -Base idea for the apple implementation and it's spawning location.
          
          
April 22, 2021 (2:00 p.m. - 6:20 p.m.):
Pair Programming.
Participants: Christian and Jomar.
Progress: -Created the apple and drew it on the grid.
          -Draw the apple in a random location in which the snake is not found once it is eaten by the snake.
          -The snake grows everytime it eats the apple.
          -The snake follows the hamiltonian path to completion until it is as long as the grid, which means that the snake finished without colliding with itself or walls.
          -Debbuged the code for errors.
          

April 27, 2021 (2:00 p.m. - 6:20 p.m.):
Pair Programming.
Participants: Christian and Jomar.
Progress: -Implemented the mix agent which used the Shortcuts and the Hamiltonian cycle for a more efficient agent.
          -Debugging and fixing error.
          
          
April 28, 2021 (2:00 p.m. - 6:20 p.m.):
Pair Programming.
Participants: Christian and Jomar.
Progress: -Created a simple interface for the game.
          -Fixed a bug with regards to the Hamiltonian cycle.
          -Debugged and fixed errors.
          -Implemented a benchmark for the agents.
          -Implemented code to provide data about the performance of each of the agents.
          -Fixing the structure of the code.
