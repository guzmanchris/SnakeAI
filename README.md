"# SnakeAI" 
The program is runned from the main.py file.

Once this file is runned, the user will be prompted with a couple of options from which he/she can decide which of the different simulations the user wants to carry out.

The user is also presented with the option of carrying a benchmark which would run the different simulations n times, being n provided by the user.
Once the benchmarks finishes, on screen the performance results for each run and each simulation will be printed.
These results will be saved in the output.txt file.
